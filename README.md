# Exploratory Data Analysis and Customer Segmentation

The repository contains analysis of historical data of an amusement park which will help the management take effective business decisions to increase their visitors. It incluses descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytical techniques as well as consumer segmentation, customer lifetime value analysis, A/B Testing, customer churn prediction, and other algorithmic processes using Python libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, statsmodels, and scipy. Using the fictional backdrop of the amusement park, we built and assessed models that predict specific consumer behavior and help management to optimize decision-making processes. The repository covers the following topics:
